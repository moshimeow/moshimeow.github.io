## About me

My legal name is Moshi Rachel Danger Turner. Call me Moshi. My pronouns are she/her or they/them.

I am transgender, ex-mormon, and a sexual assault survivor. I say this not because I want the sympathy of strangers. I want people who are going through or processing similar traumatic experiences to know that I've been there, that I've (mostly!) made it through to the other side, and that staying alive is worth it. No matter how low you are feeling, what was done to you or what you did, there is always a path to redemption. Every sentient light deserves love and respect. My contact info is at the bottom if you want to talk.

I live in Seattle, Washington but travel a lot. Ask me about my travel plans and let's hang out!

I am interested in:
* Real-time algorithms & state estimation
* Augmented reality and virtual reality. I'm especially interested in making VR avatars more compelling & useful as a tool for diagnosing body dysmorphia & dysphoria, and computing & collaboration in 3D virtual space with other people.
* Machine learning and data engineering, especially small real-time models
* Free and open-source software
* Transhumanism, life extension, ectogenesis, hormone replacement therapy & other forms of biohacking
* Having children in the next 5-10 years & alternative forms of education
* Traveling the world and trying to fit myself into different cultures. I am fluent in English, semi-fluent in Mandarin & Hindi, and can speak a lot of other languages at party trick levels.
* Various expensive sports including motorcycles, quad skates, skateboards and snowboarding
* Being a reasonably big space nerd. So far I've seen the Starship SN10 and 4/20 full-stack launch in person, and once I met Sunita Williams.
* Explorations into user-hostile retro web design

At my last job, I worked on Monado, the open-source OpenXR runtime, and Monado's hand tracking. Here's a demo of that:

I'll update this when I can talk about my current job.
