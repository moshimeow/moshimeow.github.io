## About me

My legal name is Moshi Rachel Danger Turner. Call me Moshi. My pronouns are she/her or they/them.

I live in Austin, Texas and currently work on optical hand tracking at Collabora. Recently I've taken a lot of interest in math, state estimation, AR/VR, machine learning/data engineering and FOSS. This has been a pretty crazy happy culmination of those five things.

I'm very happy about the hand tracking work, so here's the best showcase I happen to have at the moment:

I'm also known for

* Being pretty good at AR/VR demos
* Skateboarding, quad/inline skating
* Being a VRChat catgirl
* Being an annoying punk rock kid, stage diving and moshpits
* Traveling the world a bit. Still need to go to: Taipei, Shenzhen, Glacier National Park, Iquitos, Scotland.
* Being a reasonably big space nerd. So far I've seen the Starship SN10 and 4/20 full-stack launch in person, and once I met Sunita Williams.
* Being a life extension/transhumanism nerd. I absolutely am invested in the modern search for the fountain of youth
* Explorations into user-hostile retro web design
